# STU_037_BM22BTECH11017
I first calculated Flag 2 with my student id STU037.
Then I applied the filters of the number of reviews as well as average review rating but could not find any review matching Flag 2
Hence I removed this filter and then did a global search in the reviews for FLAG2
Found the review and matched it to the book Title of A Night In With Audrey Hepburn (Book 1)
Then I created FLAG 2 from this title 
Then after viewing the reviews for this book I came to realise that the book only had 6 reviews out of which 1 was fake and the remaining were genuine. 
Therefore I was unable to train my model on it.
So i picked the book with the maximum reviews and then trained the model on that.
Got Top authenticity words: ['love', 'best', 'loved'] and calculated the Flag 3 from this
